## Using Unity with Github:
1. Go [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and download Git LFS.
2. Go [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/version-control/github-for-unity-118069) and add Github for Unity to your unity assets.
3. Click the 'Open in Unity' button on the Github for Unity store page and click Download, then Import.
4. Reboot Unity (I had to do this two or three times)
5. Navigate to Window > Github, then C&P our repository link into the box that says Remote:origin, then press Fetch in the top left of the window
